{GREETING} ,

Thank you for contacting Teaching and Learning Service. I have received your request for help setting up myCourses. As a new Teaching Assistant, there are three resources that might be great to start with depending on your preference as a learner: 

TLS webinar series: https://www.mcgill.ca/tls/events 
If you prefer to view these sessions before hand, we also have some recordings from our past sessions here: https://deptkb.mcgill.ca/display/TLK/Webinars 

myCourses Essentials: https://mycourses2.mcgill.ca/d2l/home/472689
A self-paced course in myCourses in which you are enrolled that provides the basics of myCourses and get you quickly started as a Teaching Assistant. If you do not have access to myCourses Essentials for Teaching Assistants then please fill out this form.
Request Access for myCourses Essentials: https://www.mcgill.ca/skillsets/request-access-mycourses-essentials-teaching-assistants

Teaching and Learning Knowledge Base: www.mcgill.ca/teachingkb 
This will provide more in-depth guidance on each of the myCourses tools. 

If after you have reviewed this material and would still like to meet with one of our consultants, please let me know! I will be happy to put you in touch with one of them.
